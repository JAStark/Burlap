MICA INVIZ Residency 2
This project was created during a 3 1/2 day residency hackathon as part of the Maryland
Institute and College of Art Master in Professional Studies in Information Visualization
Residency 2 (phew) in collaboration with Baltimore-based charity organization Incentive Mentoring
Program (IMP). We were asked to create something with their data that they can use. We split 
into two groups and hacked! This group was Team Burlap! We had assistance from 
professionals Bryan Connor and Anthony Mattox. 



If you clone this repository, follow these instructions (I only know how to do this
on a Mac - sorry Windows users) to view the project:

open terminal and navigate to 

		/Users/Your_user_name/Burlap/GeoJSON

type 

		python -m SimpleHTTPServer



when it's done, open a browser and type

		http://localhost:8000
		

It should open a file system made up of clickable links. 

Click on

		StarkJA_onehouse.html

It should open a page with a greyscale simple map of Maryland centered on Baltimore. Click
around and see what you find. There might be pictures and other data linked to the 
map pins...
