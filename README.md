MICA INVIZ Residency 2
This project was created during a 3 1/2 day residency hackathon as part of the Maryland
Institute and College of Art Master in Professional Studies in Information Visualization
Residency 2 (phew) in collaboration with Baltimore-based charity organization Incentive Mentoring
Program (IMP). We were asked to create something with their data that they can use. We split 
into two groups and hacked! This group was Team Burlap! We had assistance from 
professionals Bryan Connor and Anthony Mattox.
